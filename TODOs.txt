TODO:
Make link work with journal_header_t -- needs to change journal_header_t
Make create_file work with journal_header_t (similar to link)
    Make unlink work with journal_header_t with no change size
    Get shrink_size to use file_index and journal_indir_block
    Make grow size with file_index and journal_indir_block
        Make unlink work with change_size (straightforward after we get change_size with journal)
            Start execute_journal
            Work for change_size
            Work for link
            Work for unlink
            Make ospfs_write write to journal and to file
                Make ospfs_write only write to file
                Make execute_journal work for writing
                 |
                 \==> DECISION: Do we make change_size happend then write everthing,
                                 or do we make change_size happen with the write? Second
                                 option simpler, first option more what we want.
                                 My vote: We wait until we are there to see if we can even
                                          do it...
